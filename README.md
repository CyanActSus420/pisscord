its discord but very very bad and shitty and also open source

sorta inspired by old IRC chats, made partially because discord pissed me off

### ui
a very ugly and ba- i mean beautiful and wonderful ui thats allows you to put servers as favorites so you dont have to type out the same ip 70 times

### the ability to host your own servers
tired of discord's barely working servers that are held together by ducttape? well no more, now its YOUR servers held together by (mostly) MY shitty code (you need to port forward the router im too broke) using my (barely working) "pseudo-dedicated" pisscord server

### joining servers as guest
do you want to say shit that would get you cancelled? well worry not! now you can just join as a guest and nobody will know who you are!

### i fucking ran out of features
fuck

## ok for real tho
this project is nothing more than a product of a retarded 17 year old who just wants to learn how to do networking shit in godot for fun

this is NOT meant to be a "discord killer" or anything like that, its all just for fun and for the sillies, and it will not be a direct replacement for discord at any point in time

please note that this project will probably be abandoned/worked on and off, and wont be maintained in the long term
